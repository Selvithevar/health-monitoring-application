1) Health Monitoring applications, a powerful platform designed to assist users in understanding and managing their health. Leveraging the capabilities of machine learning, our system analyzes user-input symptoms to predict potential diseases accurately.
2) User-Friendly Interface ,Our intuitive interface allows users to input their symptoms effortlessly, creating a seamless user experience.
3) We've integrated state-of-the-art machine learning models that accurately predict diseases based on input symptoms, ensuring reliable and precise results.
4) This is s health monitoring application , where i have trained the models by using SVM where svm is a powerful supervised algorithm that works best on smaller datasets but on complex ones. 
5) I have used the tools pandas and numpy libraries
6) There are 132 symptoms from which i have trained the model by importing csv files from kaggle and done google for some datasets
7) The system is designed for continuous improvement. As we gather more data, the machine learning models evolve, providing increasingly accurate and relevant recommendations.
